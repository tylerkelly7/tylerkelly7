# Hi, I'm **Tyler Kelly**
*Bridging statistical research, machine learning, and applied engineering.*

üéì **M.S. Biostatistics @ University of Pittsburgh**  
üí° Machine Learning | NLP | MLOps | Data Science | Statistical Analysis  
üìç Based in Pittsburgh, PA | Open to relocation

### üß† Summary
I‚Äôm passionate about **building end-to-end machine learning pipelines** ‚Äî from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment and reproducibility.  
My current graduate research focuses on developing robust, interpretable ML workflows using both structured and unstructured EHR data.

Beyond academic research, I explore **ML in healthcare**, **AI engineering**, and **quantitative finance**, experimenting with predictive modeling, reinforcement learning, and scalable deployment workflows.
